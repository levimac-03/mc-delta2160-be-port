Welcome to the **<span style="color:red;">DELTA 2160</span>** port. This repository showcases the futuristic world of DELTA 2160, originally designed for Java Edition, now seamlessly brought to Bedrock Edition.

## Conversion Process

The conversion was meticulously carried out using **Amulet V0.10.35** to ensure full compatibility with Bedrock Edition. The version ported is **DELTA 2160 v1.2**, the latest update. For more information about the tool used, visit [Amulet's official website](https://www.amuletmc.com/).

## Why Amulet?

Amulet was selected instead of JE2BE for several important reasons:

- **Detailed Chunk-Level Customization:** Crucial for preserving the intricate landscapes of DELTA 2160.
- **Entity and Tile Entity Support:** Ensures that all in-game entities and tile entities are properly transferred during the conversion.
- **Comprehensive NBT Support:** Preserves all essential map attributes during the conversion process.

While JE2BE is effective for simpler conversions, Amulet offers the precision and control needed for a complex map like DELTA 2160.
